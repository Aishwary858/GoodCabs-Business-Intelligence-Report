### Create one measure table and add some important measure for Analysis
1.Avg Driver Rating = AVERAGE(fact_trips[driver_rating])

2.Avg Fare Per Km = DIVIDE([Total Fare(Revenue)],[Total Distance Travelled],0)

3.Avg Fare Per Trip = DIVIDE([Total Fare(Revenue)],[Total Trips],0)

4.Avg Passenger Rating = AVERAGE(fact_trips[passenger_rating])

5.Avg Passenger Rating Target = AVERAGE(city_target_passenger_rating[target_avg_passenger_rating])

6.Avg Trip Distance = AVERAGE(fact_trips[distance_travelled(km)])

7.New Passengers = SUM(fact_passenger_summary[new_passengers])

8.New Passengers Actual vs New Passengers Target = DIVIDE([New Passengers]-[New Target Passengers],[New Target Passengers],0)

9.New Target Passengers = SUM(monthly_target_new_passengers[target_new_passengers])

10.New Trips = CALCULATE([Total Trips],fact_trips[passenger_type]="new")

11.New vs Repeated Passengers Trip Ratio = DIVIDE([New Trips],[Repeated Trips],0)

12.Repeat Passenger Count = SUM(dim_repeat_trip_distribution[repeat_passenger_count])

13.Repeat Passenger Rate % = DIVIDE([Repeated Passengers],[Total Passengers],0)

14.Repeated Passengers = SUM(fact_passenger_summary[repeat_passengers])

15.Repeated Trips = CALCULATE([Total Trips],fact_trips[passenger_type]="repeated")

16.Total Distance Travelled = SUM(fact_trips[distance_travelled(km)])

17.Total Fare(Revenue) = SUM(fact_trips[fare_amount])

18.Total Passengers = SUM(fact_passenger_summary[total_passengers])

19.Total Trips = DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANK(fact_trips[trip_id])

20.Trips Actual vs Trips Target = DIVIDE([Total Trips]-[Trips Target],[Trips Target],0)

21.Trips Target = SUM(monthly_target_trips[total_target_trips])
